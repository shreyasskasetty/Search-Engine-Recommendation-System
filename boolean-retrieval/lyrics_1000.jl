{"song": "Genius-how-to-annotate-and-edit-on-genius-annotated", "lyrics": "\n\n\u2727 A Genius annotation is a note that explains the deeper meaning behind lyrics. There are a few different kinds of annotations:\n\n\nLyric Annotations -> Click here for an example\n\n\nBios -> Click here for an example\n\n\nCover Art Annotations -> Click here for an example\n\nYou can also contribute to existing annotations:\n\n\nSuggestions -> Click here for an example\n\n\nProposed Edits -> Click here for an example\n\n\u2727 Here are the rules you should always follow when annotating:\n\n\nDon't Restate The Lyric -> Click here to learn more\n\n\nWrite Like A Human -> Click here to learn more\n\n\nWatch Grammar & Spelling -> Click here to learn more\n\n\nDo Research & Hyperlink Sources -> Click here to learn more\n\n\nHighlight All Relevant Lyrics -> Click here to learn more\n\n\nMaster Formatting -> Click here to learn more\n\n\nInclude Media That Adds Depth -> Click here to learn more\n\n\nBe Objective -> Click here to learn more\n\n\nBe Concise & Specific -> Click here to learn more\n\n\nBe Evergreen -> Click here to learn more\n\n\u2727 Here are some more nuanced practices you can follow to make sure your annotations are always great:\n\nUse The Active Voice: Sentences in the active voice are structured so the subject performs the action stated by the verb. Active voice is generally easier to understand. -> Click here to learn more\n\nUse Primary Sources: Wikipedia and other encyclopedic sources are great places to learn, but shouldn't be hyperlinked in annotations unless it's absolutely necessary.  Never link Urban Dictionary. -> Click here to learn more\n\nOrder By Importance: The most important information should go at the beginning of the annotation. Save images, GIFs, and videos for the middle or the end, and never start an annotation with a quote. -> Click here to learn more\n\nAvoid Hiding Info Behind Links: Don't force your readers to go hunting for the sauce. Sauce it up in the annotation and allow your links to complement what you wrote. -> Click here to learn more\n\nOnly Quote The Best Stuff: Quote what artists have said, not what others have written about them. Cut quotes to the parts that make the most sense for your annotation. -> Click here to learn more\n\nLine-Level vs. Song-Level: Info pertinent to specific lyrics should go in annotations on the relevant lines, and info about the entire song should go in the song bio or Q&A. Annotations on section headers are only rarely appropriate. -> Click here to learn more\nEditors use the Annotation Commandments to decide whether an annotation should be accepted and edited to become an official \"Genius annotation,\" or rejected if it doesn't match our editorial standards. Click here to learn about earning the Editor role.\n\n\u2727 Here are the basics of editing:\n\nAccepting & Editing: You have to accept an annotation first before you edit it. Edits can range from fixing typos to overhauling the whole thing, but the goal is to make improvements. You'll get contribution credit based on how much of the annotation you change. -> Click here to learn more\n\nRejecting: To reject an annotation, you have to select one of three main reasons: \"Restating the Line,\" \"It's a Stretch,\" or \"Missing Something.\" Selecting \"Other\" requires you to leave a note briefly explaining your rejection. -> Click here to learn more\n\nIntegrating & Archiving: You can integrate or archive suggestions and proposed edits that other users leave on annotations. Integrating brings the user's suggestion into the annotation and gives them contribution credit based on how much of the annotation they change. Archiving removes the suggestion from the annotation. -> Click here to learn more\n\nDeleting: It's sometimes necessary to delete annotations previously accepted by other editors if they're not up to standard. You'll also need to delete annotations if you're accepting and deleting a lyric correction annotation. -> Click here to learn more\n\nChanging the Referent: Click the \"Edit Lyrics\" button and copy-paste the corresponding annotation ID to change the referent. Changing the referent can ensure the annotation covers all repeated lyrics, or covers adjacent lines that closely relate to the annotation's main idea. -> Click here to learn more\n\u2727 Here are some more complicated tools and tricks for editors:\n\nMerging Annotations: To merge two annotations, copy the contents of the first annotation, integrate the info you copied into the second annotation, delete the first annotation, and adjust the referent. -> Click here to learn more\n\nResearch Methods: The citations at the bottom of Wikipedia articles and Google Books samples are goldmines. Replace boring links and lackluster sentiments with relevant and unique info that enhances the annotation.  -> Click here to learn more\n\nFact-Checking & Avoiding Bias: Be conscious about problematic lyrics or sensitive information. If an annotation states something definitively that hasn't yet been confirmed, tweak the language to be accurate, objective, and analytical. -> Click here to learn more\n\nRefining Language: No matter how well-written an annotation is, it can always be improved. Brush up on your grammar skills and be meticulous about word choice, structure, organization, and expression. -> Click here to learn more\n\nPushing the Boundaries: There are fringe scenarios where unorthodox annotation styles work, and that's how annotation culture evolves. Don't be afraid to experiment, as long as you're saying something interesting and don't violate the editorial standards. -> Click here to learn more\n\u2727 Tate Talks are forum posts about annotation culture.

{"song": "Barack-obama-on-kanye-west-kim-kardashian-success-in-america-annotated", "lyrics": "\n\n[David Blum]\nPart of the American dream\u2014even if you're poor, or lower-middle class\u2014involves yearning for tangible things you can't afford. Were there things, when you were growing up, that you yearned for that you couldn't afford?\n\n[President Barack Obama]\nI think every kid has some fantasies about what they'd like to have. But I can't tell you how many people I meet in my generation who will say, \"Looking back on it, we didn't have a lot, but we didn't feel poor.\" The reason was because the American dream involved some pretty basic stuff. A home you could call your own. A good job where you felt some security. A good education, and the ability to get a higher education if you wanted to pursue it. Health care you could count on. Retirement that you could count on. Those cornerstones of what it meant to be middle class were pretty universally held. People felt that if they worked hard they could get there. It was achievable. But I don't think people went around saying to themselves, \"I need to have a 10,000 square-foot house.\"\n\nIf you look back on your childhood, or if I talk to my friends, all of us have that same impression when we go back home and we realize that the place where we were living was pretty small. These days people would say, \"How did you live in a place that small?\" Well it didn't feel that small at the time. It was secure. It was stable. We had a car. It wasn't a fancy car, but it got you around. Were there things that all of us might have liked to have? Sure. But partly, I think, there also has been a shift in culture. We weren't exposed to the things we didn't have in the same way that kids these days are. There was not that window into the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Kids weren't monitoring every day what Kim Kardashian was wearing, or where Kanye West was going on vacation, and thinking that somehow that was the mark of success.\n\n"}

{"song": "Genius-what-is-a-mediator-annotated", "lyrics": "\n\nWhat is a Mediator?A Genius mediator is someone who has intimate knowledge of the Genius platform and consistently contributes high-quality discussions, comments, posts, and messages that foster positive Genius community culture and help the average Genius user have a better experience. A Genius mediator is also someone who has demonstrated that they can exercise sound judgment managing help requests, assisting in bug reports, and resolving disputes within the Genius community. In addition, they are responsible for squashing hateful language, abuse, harassment, trolling, and unconstructive posting through thread moderation (moving/deletion), messaging users, and suspending users when necessary.\nMediator Permissions\u2022 Magenta Username\n\u2022 Delete forum posts\n\u2022 Lock forum posts\n\u2022 Pin \"discussion\"\n\u2022 Move \"discussion\"\n\u2022 Delete \"discussion\"\n\u2022 Search user aliases\n\u2022 Mark user as spam\n\u2022 Penalty Box\n\u2022 Clear votes if vote total <0\n\u2022 See chartbeat\n\u2022 View the activity tab on user profiles\n\u2022 View user report\nBecome a MediatorIf you feel like you have a sound understanding of 'How Genius Works' and are confident that you can explain the nuances of the Genius Community, as well as resolve issues/disputes with a helpful and unbiased approach, send a moderator a message or comment on the bottom of this page and tag @genius-moderation.\nEssential Reading for MediatorsGenius tools & features, community culture, and moderation best practices are constantly evolving, so it's important mediators stay up-to-date.\n\nGenius Tools & Features\n\nMediators should:\n\n\u2022 Have an in-depth understanding of 'How Genius Works'.\n\u2022 Follow Genius Updates to make sure they're in the loop on new changes.\n\u2022 Follow Genius Help, so they can assist new and existing users in having a better Genius experience.\n\nCommunity Culture\n\nMediators should...\n\n\u2022 Understand and enforce the Genius Community Policy, Forum Guidelines, and what Language is okay/not okay in the forums.\n\u2022 Lead by example and understand that their discussions, comments, posts, and messages will be scrutinized more than the average Genius user.\n\u2022 Know how the Genius Moderation forum functions and have a clear understanding of moderation best practices.\n\nModeration Best Practices\n\nIt is essential that mediators handle conflict fairly, so here are some ways mediators can make sure their judgment isn't affected by bias:\n\n\u2022 Get the full story by talking to both sides: When mediating, it's important that you learn about both sides of the story, so you have enough information to make an informed decision. If you notice two users going back and forth in a thread, scroll up and read through the thread to see how the conflict started. Don't assume that the user with a troubled past is the one who caused the problem.\n\n\u2022 Recognize your own bias: We're all human beings, so we all have some biases. This is why it's so important for members of the moderation team to be mature and realize that their own bias may be influencing how they're handling a situation. Take a step back and look at the bigger picture so you can approach a situation objectively.\n\n\u2022 Ask for help: If you recognize that you may not be the best person to handle a certain situation or you're unsure how to proceed, post in the penalty box thread for advice, see if anyone can help in med chat, or send a message to another member of the moderation team who can give you some feedback. If you feel your bias may affect your ability to make the right choice in a situation, don't be reluctant to let someone else handle things, we're a team, and we should work together to solve these challenges.\nCan I lose my role as a Mediator?Yes. As a mediator, you are responsible for providing all Genius users with a better onsite experience. The status of a mediator's role is staff's discretion and if a mediator continuously breaks guidelines, makes poor judgment calls, or inadvertently or purposefully uses their role at the detriment of others, a moderator/community staff member will reach out to give feedback and guidance. If a mediator ignores or fails to act on multiple rounds of feedback to a satisfactory level, they will lose their role. If you have an issue with a mediator or feel like they are not serving the community to the best of their ability, contact a moderator or community staff member. Your feedback will be anonymous.\nList of current Mediators\n\n"}

So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my, my genius, my energy. Enjoy.\n\n"}
